# Professional Portfolio Website

## Description

For my professional portfolio website I tried to emulate the mock up example as a challenge. But I wanted to add my own personal style to it. This is the first responsive website page I have made, and I tried to make the code as structured and easy to read as possible. All future adjustments to the website should be easier as a result.

My biggest challenge was using the grid layout, and how that affects image placement. I gained an understanding about background-size, background-position, and object-fit properties which all manipulate images in different ways. Another challenge was having my layout change from desktop to mobile screen size. Learning how to incorporate these elements into my portfolio has taught me a lot about responsive elements, and how to research issues I come across in the future.
